# CryptoCalculator-v1.1-beta
A basic console-based cryptocurrency calculator.

Once you have downloaded the .zip file, extract it and run the .exe file. 

Once you run the application, simply follow the instructions as they appear. For now you will have to get the cryptocurrency prices manually, hopefully in a later version the calculator will have an option to retrieve the data from the web. 

CryptoCalculator makes use of for loops and arrays to avoid having to implement predefined cryptocurrencies. Instead, the user enters the number of different cryptocurrencies they have, enter the requested details about those cryptocurrencies and present all the details at the end of the data capturing process. 

The code is open source so feel free to edit it as you please, the application was written using Visual Studio 2010 C#.
